## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## This program will allow users to input a square matrix and 
## calculate the inverse of it. Then it will be cached.
## The function cacheSove will first decide if it the inverse of a 
## matrix already exists in the cache. If it does, the function 
## will output the exiting value; if not, the function will 
## calculate and output it

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
